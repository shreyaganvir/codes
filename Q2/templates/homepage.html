    <h1>Welcome to the File Upload API</h1>
    <p>Use the following endpoints to interact with the API:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>POST /file</strong>: push data to a file, this must be done in chunks as in we donâ€™t have to push the file at once. This means you can push a file in multiple parallels call. We must be
able to push more than one file if we want to.</li>
        <li><strong>GET /file?filename=&lt;filename&gt;</strong>: retrieve a file that has been uploaded. It has to be in the same order as the original
file that has been pushed to the API. We must be able to retrieve more than one file via
this endpoint, but only one file can be requested at a time</li>
    </ul>
